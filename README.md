# Debunking the List of Alleged atrocities committed by the US authorities
Correcting the record on US interventions, covert or overt, human rights matters, etc. This project relies on the established documentary record over anon allegations and sensational headlines. We must not embrace anti-intellectualism for it leads to a world of Idiocracy.
Leave your fallacies at the door.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." - President Barrack Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

Notes:
- Try to convey a sense of understanding of complex matters and history. 
Putting aside misinformed, inital moral outrage in order to learn the facts, nuance and details.
- This is a living document, it will be updated as new facts are uncovered and information pours in. 

## Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdictionof the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

The DoD has presence on only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)

### Middle East
- On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in Office, [President Biden approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/27/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-consistent-with-the-war-powers-resolution/) airstrikes on lawful infrastructure targets in eastern Syria used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were involved in recent attacks against civilians, US and coalition personnel. 0 civilians killed or wounded.

- On January 2nd, 2020, President Donald Trump [authorised a lawful](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446/Section-1264-NDAA-Notice.pdf) air strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the IRGC-Qods Force, a [designated terrorist organisation.](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos.html) "As a matter of International Law, the strike targeting Soleimani in Iraq was taken in United States national self-defense, as recongnized in Article 51 of the United Nations Chater, in response to a series of escalating armed attacks that Iran and Iran-supported militias had already conducted against the United States." For an expert semi-deepdive, I recommend this [read](https://www.lawfareblog.com/was-soleimani-killing-assassination) by two world-leading experts. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region...He had orchestrated attacks...culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and [Iraqi personnel.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)" Soleimani is a [well-documented](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-bloody-legacy-of-qasem-soleimani-11578093506) mass-murderer. His forces are known to rape innocent women on mass and commited many crimes against humanity and war crimes.

- [In September 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW), a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. According to the Department of Defense annual report covering CY19 only [8 civilians died](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/06/2002295555/-1/-1/1/SEC-1057-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-MAY-1-2020.PDF), not 30.

- US Navy SEAL, Eddie Gallagher was alleged to have killed innocent civilians. This [turned out](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/21/legal-bombshell-explodes-on-seal-war-crimes-trial/) to be a lie from his junior SEALs.
They admitted to lying about such accusations. Subsequently, Gallagher was found guilty of one crime he never challenged: Posing for a photo with a body. A complete breakdown of the back history can be found [here.](https://youtu.be/qFe-n4Eu6Mw)

- [On April 13, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/download), in coordination with the United Kingdom and France, the  United  States  attacked  three  facilities  associated  with  Syria’s  use  of  chemical weapons: the Barzeh Research and Development Center, the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons storage facility, and the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons bunker facility. There have been [many](https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/features/2018/0418_syria/img/timeline.pdf) instances of the Syrian regime using these illegal weapons on innocent civilians, which is, of course, a war crime. [No civilians](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1493658/briefing-by-secretarymattis-on-us-strikes-in-syria/) were killed or injured as a result of the US/UK/France attacks—as great care was taken to avoid them. Russia has [enabled]( https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/01/5_Lawless_StateofComplicity-1.pdf)the war crimes committed by the Syrian regime, and has also [commited](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) many themselves. Because Russia is allied with such a thuggish rogue state, and has committed hanious acts themselves, they must [deny](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2014/08/20/attempts-to-blame-the-syrian-opposition-for-the-august-21st-sarin-attacks-continue-one-year-on/), [lie](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/11/13/russia-accidentally-provide-best-evidence-syrian-governments-involvement-sarin-attacks/) and spin truth. Just as they did for their deliberate attack on civilian airline, [MH17](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) more than [once](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334396-2016-2017-ISC-AR.html) Russia has acted as a disinfo mill: Creating lies and spreading them far and wide. Through their proxy—wikileaks—Russia has spread fake news concerning a "whistleblower" in the OPCW via the leak of emails. That headline is enough to [convince](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) some to believe Syria is innocent, simply because they don't want to spend the time to fact-check. Suffice to say, the disinformation has been covered, and debunked by the [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/02/opcw-independent-investigation-possible-breaches-confidentiality-report), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/15/the-opcw-douma-leaks-part-1-we-need-to-talk-about-alex/), and many others—including a sufficient skill at [reading comprehension.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/25/emails-and-reading-comprehension-opcw-douma-coverage-misses-crucial-facts/) To quote from the OPCW, "Inspector A, he was not a member of the FFM. As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation." 

- Starting in [June 2017](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/), photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus. While it's hard to say who was deplying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” 
Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."
For an expert breakdown of the legality of WP, this [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf) provides a fantastic breakdown, as does this [entry](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct) by another expert.

- From Janurary 2015 to December 2017, US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq & Syria, monthly, often resulted in 0 civilian casualties. Most peaks never breached 20 CIVCAS. All of these strikes were conducted in full compliance of domestic and international law, and other applicable governing authorities—according to an [independent study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html). The peak from March 17 2017 came from a single airstrike that [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) just-under 112 civilians. Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional explosives that resulted in a secondary explosives.

- On April 6, 2017, following the illegal [Khan Sheykkun chemical attack](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2017_904.pdf) [by the Syrian regime](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_evaluation_nationale_-_anglais_-_final_cle0dbf47-1.pdf), the United States carried out [lawful strikes](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Assessing_US_Justifications_for_Using-Force_2.pdf) against Al Shayrat airfield, used by the regime to conduct its illegal chemical & conventional weapons attacks against civilians. 

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) 112 civilians in Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional explosives that resulted in a secondary explosives.

- From 2015 to 2020, the US had been [aiding](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390794-Acting-GC-Letter-to-Majority-Leader-Re-Sanders.html) the Saudi-led coalition in mid-air refueling (outside Yemen airspace), International Humanitarian Law compliance, and limited intelligence sharing to help further mitigate impact to civilians. US & British Governments have worked well to train, advice and develop Saudi Arabia's international law compliance, according to a UK High Court [ruling](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf)
The [Kingdom](https://www.ksrelief.org/Pages/Partners/), [US](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-6-2020-united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-aid-people-yemen), [UK](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/countries/YE), and many other countries pour in humanitarian aid as they work with the Yemen Government to fight off Iran-backed terrorist orgs.

- In 2011, President Obama authorised the [lawful, Constitutional](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) strike on a [senior al-Qa'ida member](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/107-3._panetta_declaration_6.10.2015_0.pdf), Anwar al-awlaki was the Chief of external operations. He was responsible for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the US and allied nations. He was most infamous for his pivotal role in AQAP's attempt to blow up a US airliner, bound for Detroit on December 25, 2009. The Government's [preferance was to capture him](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/doj-lethal.pdf), but it was not feasible—and was deemed continuing to be an imminent threat.
His son was killed in this strike, but was not made the target. In Janurary 2017, Trump approved a Special Forces raid in Yemen. Media alleged that among the [4-12 civilians killed](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) (not 30 as media/NGOs claim), was Anwar's 8 year old daughter. However, declassified documents from ACLU litigation have confirmed no children were killed. [Women were among the combatants](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400-Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.html#document/p1).

- In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.
[The first](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF) report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed. Following this, the [2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf) report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."
For an overview of the domestic, international law and policy frameworks that guide US Military operations, especially as they relate to Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia: See this [compendium](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Legal_Policy_Report.pdf) provided in 2016 by the Obama administration.

- US involvement in Syria has concerned AQ and ISIS, since the regime has been either unwilling or unable to address the threat they pose to allied countries, such as the US. These nations are [allowed](https://lawfareblog.com/who-board-unwilling-or-unable) this right under [international law and a moral obligation to address these threats](https://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA484155766&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00948381&p=AONE&sw=w).
US aid to SDF and other groups are only [allowed](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3032777/DOD-Section-1209-Report-Assistance-to-VSO-Mar.pdf) if they do not engage in [human rights abuses](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3032778/Section-1209-Report-Department-of-Defense.pdf) and [not connected to terrorism](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3525400/FOIA-Final-Response-2015-00974.pdf).

- In 2011, Dictator and criminal, Muammar Gaddafi, due to peaceful protests caused by the Arab Spring started to slaughter innocent, paceful civilians with [lethal force](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Libya%20S%20PV%206528.pdf). For months he threatened to slaughter civilians—to the international communities warnings to not follow through. He did. Sending his forces out. Under UNSC Resolution 1973, a [no-fly zone](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/2013/pubs/the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-and-libya-reviewing-operation-unified-protector/) was established. This [resolution](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Wings-Over-Libya%3A-The-No-Fly-Zone-in-Legal-Schmitt/822ce0de5bb2451fe0ab967436b555111a156ee8) also provided member states to use [all neccisary means](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/2011/04/31/authority-military-use-in-libya_0.pdf) to [enforce compliance](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/204673-united-states-activities-in-libya-6-15-11.html). The intervention by the international community was seen as [popular](http://news.gallup.com/poll/156539/opinion-briefing-libyans-eye-new-relations-west.aspx) by Libyans. The [United States](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/us-assistance-to-egypt-tunisia-and-libya) and the international community has since been [addressing](https://ly.usembassy.gov/the-us-commits-6-million-usd-in-humanitarian-assistance-to-libya-for-the-covid-19-response/) matters [since](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33142.pdf) then.
Gaddafi was also a lover of brutish assassins to kill off dissedents, journalists, human rights activits and even attempts on heads of state and soon-to-be-rulers of Kingdoms. Thanks to the NSA, with new authorities granted under the Patriot Act, and other traditional SIGINT and hard work, and made public thanks to Snowden—we can see just one such assassination plot was [thwarted](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4389688-The-Saudi-Assassination-Plot-How-It-Was-Thwarted.html). What was the crime? A perceived insult. "This wealth of information tied the plot directly to Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qhadafi."

- From 2001 up to the present day, the drone campaign has resulted in disrupting many terrorist networks, and resulted in very few civilian casualties. Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, confirmed as a result of Congressional oversight, that the civilian deaths per year as a result of drone strikes is often in the [single digits](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/11331.pdf). Lethal strikes are only sought if [capture of HVTs is not feasible](https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-library/procedures_for_approving_direct_action_against_terrorist_targets/download). Leaked documents from the Intercept confirm that these missions (including ground raids) result in very few civilian casualties. From September 16, 2011 to September 16, 2012 in Afghanistan, out of a total of 2,082 missions only 14 civilians were killed or injured. That's 0.67%. 
Another document leaked confirms the time and care taken into approving each strike. Missions can only be approved by POTUS if the host nation consents. See [slide 6](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460856-small-footprint-operations-may-2013.html) and [slides 41 and 42](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2460855-small-footprint-operations-february-2013.html).
From these, a picture starts to emerge:
  - The “average approval time” for a proposed strike under the AUMF process was 79 days. Even excluding the single longest approval, presumably an unrepresentative outlier, the average was 58 days. The fastest approval was 27 days.
  - These approvals were preceded by lengthy periods of gathering and analyzing intelligence on the targets—an average of six years.
  - Four out of 24 proposed concepts of operations covered by the study were disapproved under the AUMF review process.
  - The process for approving strikes under the AUMF “requires significant intel/ISR to justify (and maintain) approvals.” “Relatively few, high-level terrorists meet criteria for targeting” under this process. (Note that this isn’t a press release touting the program’s robust oversight; it’s an internal DOD assessment, written from the perspective of operators for whom a laborious approval process is an obstacle rather than a virtue.)
  - These “[p]olitical constraints” make these operations “challenging” and “fundamentally different from what we’ve experienced in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

- On 3 October, 2015, a United States Air Force AC-130U accidently missidentified the Kunduz Trauma Centre, operated by Doctors without Borders. Per an [independent investigation](http://fpp.cc/wp-content/uploads/01.-AR-15-6-Inv-Rpt-Doctors-Without-Borders-3-Oct-15_CLEAR.pdf), "The ground force and aircrew were unaware theaircrew was firing on a hospital throughout the course of the engagement." This was caused due to technical and human error. "Due to the early launch, the aircrew did not have the typical information it would have on a mission. While enroute to Kunduz, one of the aircraft's critical communications systems failed, resulting in the aircraft's inability to recieve and transmit certain critical information to multiple command headquaters." While tragic—this is not a war crime. While hospitals are indeed protected buildings under international law, there are caveats: 1. A building can lose its protected status. 2. A building can become [duel-status](https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-081009-011.pdf), see page 84 of this scholarly paper—and yet, it's a [real thing, see page 6 of this investigation](https://archive.org/details/informal-ar-15-6-investigation-findings-and-recommendations-for-the-al-hawijah), not just in academic theory. If part of the building is used by combatants while the rest by civilians;only that area may be targeted. 3. An accident. Since the tribunals of WW2, there has been a principle formed known as the Rendulic standard. To quote from the [2020 updated Operational Law Handbook](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/operational-law-handbook_2020.pdf), "The “Rendulic Rule:”  The Rendulic case also stands for a broader standard regarding liability for battlefield acts: commanders and personnel should be evaluated based on information reasonably available at the time of decision...There may be situations where, because of incomplete intelligence or the failure of the enemy to abide by the LOAC, civilian casualties occur.  Example:  The Iraqi Al Firdos C3 Bunker.  During the first Persian Gulf War (1991), U.S. military planners identified this Baghdad bunker as an Iraqi military command and control center. Barbed wire surrounded the complex, it was camouflaged, armed sentries guarded its entrance and exit points, and electronic intelligence identified its activation.  Unknown to coalition planners, some Iraqi civilians used upper levels of the facility as nighttime sleeping quarters.  The bunker was bombed, resulting in over 400 civilian deaths.  Was there a violation of the LOAC?  Not by U.S. forces, but there was a clear violation of the principle of distinction (discussed infra) by Iraqi forces.  Based upon information gathered by Coalition planners, the commander made an assessment that the target was a military objective.  Although the attack may have resulted in unfortunate civilian deaths, there was no LOAC violation because the attackers acted in good faith based upon the information reasonably available at the time the decision to attack was made."

- On 22 August, 2008, a US aitstrike killed civilians. At this point, it must be stressed that just because their are civilian casualties, doesn't make it an "atrocity" or "a war crime". Aside from the legal reasons detailed above—and ignoring all the investigations cited into specific cases like this, I think it wise to illustrate, just a little, from a [declassified](https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457520263/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true&access_key=key-fweBwYAO9yAPU3yVCddw) email to questions concerning the above CIVCAS investigation, by member of Advanced Target Development, just how much care they put in. "To be 'executable', the solution needs to be a low CDR call due to the Non-combatant casualty value (NCV) of zero."
