# List of Alleged atrocities committed by US authorities, corrected
Correcting the record on US interventions, covert or overt, human rights matters, etc. This project relies on the established documentary record over anon allegations and sensational headlines. We must not embrace anti-intellectualism for it leads to a world of Idiocracy.
Leave your fallacies at the door.

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." - President Barrack Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016
