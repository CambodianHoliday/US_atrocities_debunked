# Debunking the List of Alleged atrocities committed by the US authorities
Correcting the record on US interventions, covert or overt, human rights matters, etc. This project relies on the established documentary record over anon allegations and sensational headlines. We must not embrace anti-intellectualism for it leads to a world of Idiocracy.
Leave your fallacies at the door.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." - President Barrack Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

Notes:
- Try to convey a sense of understanding of complex matters and history. 
Putting aside misinformed, inital moral outrage in order to learn the facts, nuance and details.
- This is a living document, it will be updated as new facts are uncovered and information pours in. 

## Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdictionof the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

The DoD has presence on only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)

### Middle East
- On February 25th, 2021, in his first month in Office, [President Biden approved](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/27/a-letter-to-the-speaker-of-the-house-and-president-pro-tempore-of-the-senate-consistent-with-the-war-powers-resolution/) airstrikes on lawful infrastructure targets in eastern Syria used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were involved in recent attacks against civilians, US and coalition personnel. 0 civilians killed or wounded.

- On January 2nd, 2020, President Donald Trump [authorised a lawful](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446/Section-1264-NDAA-Notice.pdf) air strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, leader of the IRGC-Qods Force, a [designated terrorist organisation.](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos.html) "As a matter of International Law, the strike targeting Soleimani in Iraq was taken in United States national self-defense, as recongnized in Article 51 of the United Nations Chater, in response to a series of escalating armed attacks that Iran and Iran-supported militias had already conducted against the United States." For an expert semi-deepdive, I recommend this [read](https://www.lawfareblog.com/was-soleimani-killing-assassination) by two world-leading experts. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region...He had orchestrated attacks...culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and [Iraqi personnel.](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/)" Soleimani is a [well-documented](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-bloody-legacy-of-qasem-soleimani-11578093506) mass-murderer. His forces are known to rape innocent women on mass and commited many crimes against humanity and war crimes.

- [In September 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW), a US drone strike targeted Da'esh terrorists in Nangarha province, according to Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. According to the Department of Defense annual report covering CY19 only [8 civilians died](https://media.defense.gov/2020/May/06/2002295555/-1/-1/1/SEC-1057-CIVILIAN-CASUALTIES-MAY-1-2020.PDF), not 30.

- US Navy SEAL, Eddie Gallagher was alleged to have killed innocent civilians. This [turned out](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/06/21/legal-bombshell-explodes-on-seal-war-crimes-trial/) to be a lie from his junior SEALs.
They admitted to lying about such accusations. Subsequently, Gallagher was found guilty of one crime he never challenged: Posing for a photo with a body. A complete breakdown of the back history can be found [here.](https://youtu.be/qFe-n4Eu6Mw)

- [On April 13, 2018](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/file/1067551/download), in coordination with the United Kingdom and France, the  United  States  attacked  three  facilities  associated  with  Syria’s  use  of  chemical weapons: the Barzeh Research and Development Center, the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons storage facility, and the Him Shinshar chemical-weapons bunker facility. There have been [many](https://dod.defense.gov/portals/1/features/2018/0418_syria/img/timeline.pdf) instances of the Syrian regime using these illegal weapons on innocent civilians, which is, of course, a war crime. [No civilians](https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/1493658/briefing-by-secretarymattis-on-us-strikes-in-syria/) were killed or injured as a result of the US/UK/France attacks—as great care was taken to avoid them. Russia has [enabled]( https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/01/5_Lawless_StateofComplicity-1.pdf)the war crimes committed by the Syrian regime, and has also [commited](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html) many themselves. Because Russia is allied with such a thuggish rogue state, and has committed hanious acts themselves, they must [deny](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2014/08/20/attempts-to-blame-the-syrian-opposition-for-the-august-21st-sarin-attacks-continue-one-year-on/), [lie](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/11/13/russia-accidentally-provide-best-evidence-syrian-governments-involvement-sarin-attacks/) and spin truth. Just as they did for their deliberate attack on civilian airline, [MH17](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/11/12/the-grus-mh17-disinformation-operations-part-1-the-bonanza-media-project/) more than [once](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334396-2016-2017-ISC-AR.html) Russia has acted as a disinfo mill: Creating lies and spreading them far and wide. Through their proxy—wikileaks—Russia has spread fake news concerning a "whistleblower" in the OPCW via the leak of emails. That headline is enough to [convince](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) some to believe Syria is innocent, simply because they don't want to spend the time to fact-check. Suffice to say, the disinformation has been covered, and debunked by the [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/02/opcw-independent-investigation-possible-breaches-confidentiality-report), [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2020/01/15/the-opcw-douma-leaks-part-1-we-need-to-talk-about-alex/), and many others—including a sufficient skill at [reading comprehension.](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2019/11/25/emails-and-reading-comprehension-opcw-douma-coverage-misses-crucial-facts/) To quote from the OPCW, "Inspector A, he was not a member of the FFM. As described by the investigators, Inspector A played a minor supporting role in the investigation of the Douma incident, and he did not have access to all of the information gathered by the FFM team, including witness interviews, laboratory results, and analyses by independent experts. Although Inspector A’s assessment purports to be an official OPCW FFM report on the Douma incident, it is instead a personal document created with incomplete information and without authorisation." 

- Starting in [June 2017](https://www.snopes.com/news/2017/06/12/u-s-led-forces-accused-using-white-phosphorus-syria-iraq/), photos and videos from Raqqa, Syria claiming to have shown alleged US-backed groups "illegally" using white phosphorus. While it's hard to say who was deplying it—mere use of WP is not a war crime. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon told the Washington Post that the U.S. military only uses white phosphorus in “accordance with the law of armed conflict” – for example “for screening, obscuring and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures.” 
Other Coalition forces have used WP in this manner before, in other countries: Talking to NPR, New Zealand Brig. Gen. Hugh McAslan said, "We have utilized white phosphorus to screen areas within west Mosul to get civilians out safely."
For an expert breakdown of the legality of WP, this [scholarly paper](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/08-2006.pdf) provides a fantastic breakdown, as does this [entry](https://www.lawfareblog.com/jus-bello-white-phosphorus-getting-law-correct) by another expert.

- From Janurary 2015 to December 2017, US air and artillery strikes conducted in Iraq & Syria, monthly, often resulted in 0 civilian casualties. Most peaks never breached 20 CIVCAS. All of these strikes were conducted in full compliance of domestic and international law, and other applicable governing authorities—according to an [independent study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7048479-2018-Civilian-Casualty-Military-Study.html). The peak from March 17 2017 came from a single airstrike that [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) just-under 112 civilians. Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional explosives that resulted in a secondary explosives.

- On April 6, 2017, following the illegal [Khan Sheykkun chemical attack](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2017_904.pdf) [by the Syrian regime](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/170425_-_evaluation_nationale_-_anglais_-_final_cle0dbf47-1.pdf), the United States carried out [lawful strikes](https://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Assessing_US_Justifications_for_Using-Force_2.pdf) against Al Shayrat airfield, used by the regime to conduct its illegal chemical & conventional weapons attacks against civilians. 

- On March 17 2017, a US airstrike [accidently killed](https://www3.centcom.mil/foialibrary/cases/17-0341/1._ar_15_6_investigation__part_1___a__clear.pdf) 112 civilians in Mosul. Again, Unknown to Iraq & US forces, ISIS was holding onto civilian hostages. Also unknown to Iraq and US forces was the presence of additional explosives that resulted in a secondary explosives.

- From 2015 to 2020, the US had been [aiding](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4390794-Acting-GC-Letter-to-Majority-Leader-Re-Sanders.html) the Saudi-led coalition in mid-air refueling (outside Yemen airspace), International Humanitarian Law compliance, and limited intelligence sharing to help further mitigate impact to civilians. US & British Governments have worked well to train, advice and develop Saudi Arabia's international law compliance, according to a UK High Court [ruling](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-oao-campaign-against-arms-trade-v-ssfit-and-others1.pdf)
The [Kingdom](https://www.ksrelief.org/Pages/Partners/), [US](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-6-2020-united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-aid-people-yemen), [UK](https://devtracker.fcdo.gov.uk/countries/YE), and many other countries pour in humanitarian aid as they work with the Yemen Government to fight off Iran-backed terrorist orgs.

- In 2011, President Obama authorised the [lawful, Constitutional](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/pages/attachments/2015/04/02/2010-07-16_-_olc_aaga_barron_-_al-aulaqi.pdf) strike on a [senior al-Qa'ida member](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/107-3._panetta_declaration_6.10.2015_0.pdf), Anwar al-awlaki was the Chief of external operations. He was responsible for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the US and allied nations. He was most infamous for his pivotal role in AQAP's attempt to blow up a US airliner, bound for Detroit on December 25, 2009. The Government's [preferance was to capture him](https://fas.org/irp/eprint/doj-lethal.pdf), but it was not feasible—and was deemed continuing to be an imminent threat.
His son was killed in this strike, but was not made the target. In Janurary 2017, Trump approved a Special Forces raid in Yemen. Media alleged that among the [4-12 civilians killed](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/uscentcomfoia17-0328l_ocr_0.pdf) (not 30 as media/NGOs claim), was Anwar's 8 year old daughter. However, declassified documents from ACLU litigation have confirmed no children were killed. [Women were among the combatants](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5553400-Attachment-4-SOCOM-ARR-YEMEN-2.html#document/p1).

In 2016, Obama released, per EO 13732 Sec. 3, data concerning High Value Target CT missions Outside Areas of Active Hostilities.
[The first](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Press%20Releases/DNI+Release+on+CT+Strikes+Outside+Areas+of+Active+Hostilities.PDF) report covers from Jan 2009 to Dec 2015. It shows that there was a total of 473 strikes with a total of between 2372-2581 combatants killed and only between 64-117 civilians killed. Following this, the [2016](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Summary-of-2016-Information-Regarding-United-States-Counterterrorism-Strikes-Outside-Areas-of-Active-Hostilities.pdf) report was issued, giving us: 53 total strikes. With 431-441 combatants killed and only 1 civilian killed. Both records make clear to refute the allegations that any "military-aged male" in area of target is deemed a combatant. To quote, "Males of military age may be non-combatants; it is not the case that all military-aged males in the vicinity of a target are deemed to be combatants."
