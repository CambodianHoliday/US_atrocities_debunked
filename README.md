# List of Alleged atrocities committed by US authorities, corrected
Correcting the record on US interventions, covert or overt, human rights matters, etc. This project relies on the established documentary record over anon allegations and sensational headlines. We must not embrace anti-intellectualism for it leads to a world of Idiocracy.
Leave your fallacies at the door.

_Definition: An extremely wicked or cruel act, typically one involving physical violence or injury._

> "Around the world, the United States has promoted freedom: We have worked to expand the protection of human rights, end gender-based violence, and defend the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and the press. In promoting these liberties and pushing back against tyranny, corruption, and oppression, we have recognized that universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. They are the birthright of people everywhere." - President Barrack Obama, Presidential Proclamation - Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2016

Notes:
- Try to convey a sense of understanding of complex matters and history. 
Putting aside misinformed, inital moral outrage in order to learn the facts, nuance and details.
- This is a living document, it will be updated as new facts are uncovered and information pours in. 

## Imperialism
- It has been alleged that the US maintains an "imperialistic network" of over 800 military bases in 70 countries.
This is misleading and in factual error.
  - Site: A specific geographic location that has individual land parcels or facilities assigned to it.  Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  A site may be contiguous to another site, but cannot geographically overlap or be within another site. A site may exist in one of three forms:  land only– where no facilities are present; facility or facilities only– where there the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government, and land with facilities –where both are present.
  - Installation:  A military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdictionof the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD’s activities.  An installation may consist of one or more sites.  

The DoD has presence on only 45 countries, for a total of only 514 sits as of [2018.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/BSI/Base%20Structure%20Report%20FY18.pdf) This is at the full [consent of host countries.](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TIF-2020-Full-website-view.pdf)
